#Abstract

The following code was created in a Google Colab environment utilizing tensorflow, keras a convolutional neural network in Keras with TensorFlow as backend from scratch to classify patients as infected with COVID or not using their chest x-ray images. Our goal is to create an image classifier with Tensorflow by implementing a CNN to differentiate between chest x rays images with a COVID 19 infections versus without. The dataset contains the lungs X-ray images of both groups. We will be carrying out the entire project on the Google Colab environment. Please be aware of the fact that the dataset and the model in this project, can not be used in the real-life. We are only using this data for educational purposes. The image utilized to test the model created is linked below.
